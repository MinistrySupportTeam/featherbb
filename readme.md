## About

FeatherBB is an open source forum application released under the GNU General Public
Licence. It is free to download and use and will remain so. FeatherBB is a fork of
FluxBB 1.5 based on Slim Framework and designed to be simple and very lightweight,
with modern features: MVC architecture, PDO, OOP and a plugin system. Maybe more?
You are more than welcome to join the development :-)
